# ⚠️  Changes
I do not plan to make changes beyond "making it work" for myself.
Feel free to open PRs. If there is an issue "getting it to work" open an issue.
If you have a problem with the colors, feel free to plead your case.

gruvbox is heavily inspired by badwolf, jellybeans and solarized.

Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of solarized.
The main focus when developing gruvbox is to keep colors easily distinguishable, contrast enough and still pleasant for the eyes.
